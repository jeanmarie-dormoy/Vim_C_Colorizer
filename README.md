# Vim_C_Colorizer

Author: Jean-Marie DORMOY	<dormoy.jeanmarie@gmail.com>

I modified papercolor.vim color scheme provided by Nikyle Nguyen and wrote
additional C syntax in the c.vim provided by Bram Moolenar.

## Installation ##

Just put the :
* c.vim file in /usr/share/vim/vim81/syntax directory
* papercolor.vim file in /usr/share/vim/vim81/colors directory

or move them to ~/.vim/syntax and ~/.vim/colors respectively
